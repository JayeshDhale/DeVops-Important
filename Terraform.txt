-----------------------------------terraform infrastructure as a code (IaC)
Its a open source tool, by which we can automate the provisioning of resources in cloud

Benifits of Infrastrucutre as a code
1)Cost reduction -->reduced labor cost
2)Speed of execution -->its faster to provision infra programmatically
3)Reduced Risk --> minimizes errors and security violations
terraform supports HCL(Hashi Corp Lang) and JSON
Cloudformation supports:JSON and YAML

terraform --version ---->latest version of Terraform (0.12.26)
terraform plan --->to check its behaviour use plan

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

terraform init  ---> first always initialize terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve
terraform destroy --auto-approve ---> to delete the deployments or provision made

===================== to launch windows ec2 instance -allow_rdp
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-066663db63b3aa675"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name = "terraform-key"
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.allow_rdp.name}"]

}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_rdp" {
  name        = "allow_rdp"
  description = "Allow rdp traffic"

  ingress {

    from_port   = 3389 #  By default, the windows server listens on TCP port 3389 for RDP
    to_port     = 3389
    protocol =   "tcp"

    cidr_blocks =  ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
==========================Terraform Remote State on Amazon S3
When you enter terraform apply command in a directory, terraform saves the state of the resources changed in a file called the 
state file that is named terraform.tfstate in your working directory.
This file is how terraform knows what to change, or destroy when you use terraform apply or destroy after creating a stack of resources.
This state is stored by default in a local file named "terraform.tfstate", but it can also be stored remotely, 
which works better in a team environment.

Remote state is a feature of backends
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "cloudyeti-terraform"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

Terraform Remote State Locking by using DynamoDB
1.create dynamoDB database
2.create dynamoDB table say "terraformtable" use Primary Key value "LockID" & create table
3.terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "cloudyeti-terraform"
    key    = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraformtable"
  }
}

Now when you apply it creates entry in dynamodb table,which creates a lock on state file.
Once current users operation is finished, then only it will be available for other user to use.

======================Multiple terraform configuration (.tf) files=================
provider.tf ,ec2.tf and security.tf
when you apply terrform apply command it look for all .tf files in alphabetical order

====================Terraform Variables | Launch Amazon EC2 using variables=======
variable "ec2-key" {} # this is how you declare a variable.

variable "ami" {default='ami-0080e4c5bc078760e'} # You can have default values for variables

resource "aws_instance" "web-server" {
  ami = "${var.ami}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name = "${var.ec2-key}"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.allow_ssh.id}"]

  tags {
    Name = "terraform-web-server"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow ssh traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22 #
    to_port     = 22
    protocol =   "tcp"

    cidr_blocks =  ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

There are multiple ways to pass in variables when running the terraform apply command. In the order of preference

1.as a command line flag
$ terraform apply -var 'key-name=my-key'

2.A seperate variable file which you reference like this while running the script.
terraform apply  -var-file="vars.tfvars"

For all files which match terraform.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars present in the current directory, Terraform automatically loads them to 
populate variables. If the file is named something else, you can use the -var-file flag directly to specify a file. These files are 
the same syntax as Terraform configuration files.

3.Environment variables: Terraform will read environment variables in the form of TF_VAR_name to find the value for a variable. 
For example, the TF_VAR_access_key variable can be set to set the access_key variable.

4.If none of the first 3 steps are used to set variables, you are asked for variables when you run terraform apply.

$ terraform apply
var.ec2-key
  Enter a value:

5.Default variable values. You could set a default value when declaring the variable.
variable "ec2-key" { default = "my-key"}
============================
Terraform Map And Lookup function
Maps are a collection of string keys and string values. These can be useful for selecting values based on predefined parameters such as 
the server configuration by the monthly price.

lookup(map,Key,[default])

Example 1
===============================
Maps are a way to create variables that are lookup tables. An example will show this best. Let's extract our AMIs into a map and add 
support for the us-west-2 region as well:

variable "amis" {
  type = "map"
  default = {
    "us-east-1" = "ami-b374d5a5"
    "us-west-2" = "ami-4b32be2b"
  }
}

A variable can have a map type assigned explicitly, or it can be implicitly declared as a map by specifying a default value that is a map. 
The above demonstrates both.

Then, replace the aws_instance with the following:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.amis[var.region]
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

Example 2
===============================
variable "plans" {
    type = "map"
    default = {
        "5USD"  = "1xCPU-1GB"
        "10USD" = "1xCPU-2GB"
        "20USD" = "2xCPU-4GB"
    }
}
plan = "${var.plans["5USD"]}"

The values matching to their keys can also be used to look up information in other maps. 
For example, underneath is a short list of plans and their corresponding storage sizes.

variable "storage_sizes" {
    type = "map"
    default = {
        "1xCPU-1GB"  = "25"
        "1xCPU-2GB"  = "50"
        "2xCPU-4GB"  = "80"
    }
}
These can then be used to find the right storage size based on the monthly price as defined in the previous example.

size = "${lookup(var.storage_sizes, var.plans["5USD"])}"

variable "set_password" {
    default = false
}

Example 3
===============================
# Use Case of for_each

variable "account_name" {
   type = "map"
  default = {
      "account1" = "devops1"
      "account2" = "devops2"
      "account3" = "devops3"
}
}
resource "aws_iam_user" "iamuser" {
  for_each = var.account_name
  name = "${each.value}-iam"
}
===================================Terraform Conditions
variable "env" {
	default = "prod"
}

count = "${var.env == prod ? 1 : 0}"  -->Terraform Conditions

1.What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code software tool created by HashiCorp. It is a tool for building, changing, 
and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as 
custom in-house solutions.

2. How to Terraform work?

Terraform produce an execution plan delineate, what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the 
described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental 
execution plans which can be applied.

3. Explain the uses of Terraform CLI?

Terraform is controlled via a very easy to use the command-line interface (CLI) it is only a single command-line 
application: terraform. This application then takes a subcommand such as "apply" or "plan". The complete list of subcommands 
is in the navigation to the left.

4. what are the features of Terraform?
Some features of Terraform are:-

Graphing - Its features of graphing that are built-in are helpful in visualizing the infrastructure.
Custom Syntax - Its custom syntax is very friendly which aids in enhancing efficiency.
Resource Relationships - A very beneficial feature of terraforming is that it is able to understand resource relationships.
Updates - The updates and features are added by the Open Source Project. It does so with a group of lots of contributors.
Improved Maintenance - It is capable of breaking down the configuration into small parts or chunks for improving the organization and the maintenance.

5. What are the components of Terraform?

The two components are the Terraform Core and Terraform Plugins.

The Terraform Core utilizes remote procedure calls (RPCs) for communicating with Terraform Plugins. In addition, 
Terraform Core also offers diverse ways of discovering and loading plugins according to requirements.
The Terraform Plugins represent an implementation for a specific service such as bash or AWS or provisioner.

6. What are the reasons to choose Terraform for DevOps?

To choose to Terraform for DevOps one important reason people consider Terraform is to manage their infrastructure as code. 
Infrastructure as code is also a key and foundation for DevOps practices such as version control, code review, continuous 
integration, and continuous deployment.

7. Define Modules in Terraform.

Modules in terraforming is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Every Terraform configuration has at 
least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.

8. what is the Terraform cloud?

Terraform Cloud is a SaaS that we support—that instead when you run Terraform you still could run it on your local machine, 
but now it saves and retrieves the state file from Terraform Cloud—which is running over here. Terraform Cloud removes many 
of the complexities in trying to maintain your own Terraform state files in a multi-team.

9. How to check the installed version of Terraform?

To check the version, launch Windows PowerShell and enter: terraform -version.

10. Explain the Provisioners in Terraform.

Provisioners are used to model specific actions on the local machine or on a remote machine in order to prepare servers or 
other infrastructure objects for service.

11. What is the difference between Terraform and CloudFormation?

CloudFormation covers almost all bits and parts of AWS. Terraform covers the most important AWS resources as well. 
But on top of that Terraform can provision infrastructure at other cloud providers as well as 3rd party services

12. What is the null resource in Terraform?

The null_resource resource implements the standard resource lifecycle but takes no further action. The triggers argument 
allows specifying an arbitrary set of values that, when changed, will cause the resource to be replaced.

13. How do you use count terraform?

we just use [count. index] to dynamically specify the current iteration of the script!

14. What is a terraform provider?

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, 
containers, and more. A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.

15. List Some notable applications of Terraform.

Heroku App setup
Self-service clusters
Development of multi-tier applications
Creation of disposable environments
Multi-cloud deployment
Resource schedulers
Developing software demos

16. Where is terraform D?

Terraform. d/plugins on most operating systems and %APPDATA%\terraform. d\plugins on Windows. By default, terraform init 
searches the following directories for plugins.
============================
Where can you find official modules to use with Terraform?
On the Terraform module repository

In the import command, what do the ADDR and ID fields represent?
ADDR is the Terraform identifier; ID is the provider identifier.

How is the source for a template defined?
Either in-line or from a file

What command must be run to configure the backend in Terraform?
terraform init

What environment variable lets Terraform know it’s running in an automation context?
TF_IN_AUTOMATION

What is the purpose of running the terraform init command?
Init will download the required plugins and modules for the configuration.

What does the import command do?
Imports an existing, unmanaged resource into the Terraform configuration

Which option tells Terraform to use a local directory for plugins?
-plugin-dir=

Why would you use the option ‘-input=false’ when running terraform init?
It prevents Terraform from prompting the user for input.
