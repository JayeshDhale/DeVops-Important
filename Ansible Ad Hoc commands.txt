============================================= Ansible 2.17
to add user on hosts from master

first make changes in hosts  vi /etc/sudoers set no password
systemctl restart sshd

then on master run below command
ansible webservers -m user -a "name=john password=john" -s

cross verify on host
id john
=================================== day 6
setup module in Ansible, it will show details of host (group) just like facts in Puppet
ansible webservers -m setup

ansible webservers -m setup -a "filter=ansible_user*"	#use some filter, will show you only those details

to check number of hosts to be targeted
ansible-playbook palybook.yml --list-hosts

to check syntax
ansible-playbook palybook.yml --syntax-check

we can write script file with extention .sh  		#say file is present at tmp location
run by #sh /tmp/test.sh

To check any software or package isnatlled or not use
rpm -qa git

sudo yum install wget

to check some default values, you can also change it as per ur need
cat ansible.cfg
================================
cd /etc/ansible/hosts
-------------------------------------
host file examples
client.learnitguide.net
-------------------------------------
[oracle-servers]
oracle-a.learnitguide.net
oracle-b.learnitguide.net
oracle-c.learnitguide.net
or
oracle-[a-c].learnitguide.net

[web-servers]
web1.learnitguide.net
web2.learnitguide.net
web3.learnitguide.net
or
web[1-3].learnitguide.net
-------------------------------------
if you want to run with different users or override default user
client.learnitguide.net ansible_user=john

ansible all -m ping --- ping module
ansible web-servers -m ping
ansible web-servers -m shell -a "uptime"  ---- shell module

say we have created another hosts file at diffrent location /root/hostfile i.e. overriding default path
ansible -i /root/hostfile web-servers -m shell -a "uptime"

ansible all -a "uname -a" -- used option rather than module
ansible all -a uptime -- used module

ansible-doc -l | more   ----- to list all of the modules present
ansible-doc -l |more |wc -l  ---- to list number of modules
ansible-doc user --- will show you details of that particular module

ansible all -i inventory -m user -a "name=john state=present"    --- to check user is there or not and if not it will add
ansible all -i inventory -m user -a "name=john password=redhat"
to cross verify user us created on client machine use --> id john

to delete user from client machine use --> userdel -r john

ansible all -a "yum install httpd -y"  ---here we just passing the command on client machine by using -a argument
to cross verify package has been installed on client machine use --> rpm -q httpd

ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"  ---> yum module
====================================
ansible configuration file
rpm -ql ansible |more   ---> to check the number of files present in system
/etc/ansible ---> default file location
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
/etc/ansible/roles

#some basic dafault values

#inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
#library = /usr/share/my_modules/
#forks = 5
#poll_interval =15

having multiple config file is suitable to handle complex requirements, nearly all parameters can be overridden in 
ansible-playbooks or with command line flags
ANSIBLE_CONFIG -> ansible.cfg in current working directory
-> home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
========================================
Ansible Roles & galaxy

ansible-galaxy init /etc/ansible/roles/apache --offline ---> this will create clean directory structure here role is apache
tree /etc/ansible/roles/apache/    ---> to list out the directory structure
we have 
-- README.md
-- defaults		---defaults variables for the roles to be used for this specific deployments
  -- main.yml
-- files		--files required to transfer or deploy to target machine via these roles
-- handlers		--which can be used by these roles or anywhere outside these roles
  -- main.yml 
-- meta			--info about this roles something like dependancy ,version ,supported platforms etc..
  -- main.yml 
-- tasks		--main list of task to be executed by this roles, deploy to client machine
  -- main.yml 
-- templates		-- dynamic files 
-- tests		--test directory
  -- inventory
  -- test.yml
-- vars		  --other variables for this roles, this has higest precedance than defaults, both used for declaring variables
  -- main.yml 

ex. /etc/ansible/roles/apache 
- import_tasks: install.yml
- import_tasks: configure.yml
- import_tasks: service.yml

to execute go to /etc/ansible create a file say "vi runsetup.yml" and define roles that has to be exeuted ex.

---
 - hosts: webserver
   roles:
   - apache
   - nfs
   - ftp

ansible-playbook runsetup.yml --syntax-check     -----> to check the syntax errors
to verify on client machine use --> rpmquery httpd
access the web page from client use --> elink http://webserver(node2)
=================================
Ansible Vault to Protect Ansible Playbooks with Encryption
Ansible Vault is a feature of ansible to encrypt/decrypt utility for ansible data files
Say u have created a plybook now anyone can view by using cat users.yml now encrypt it

>>ansible-vault encrypt users.yml
it will ask you valut password: > confirm password > will show encryption completed
now if you view by cat users.yml > data will be in encrypted form

to view encrypted file
ansible-vault view users.yml
Valult Password:  (enter password here)

to edit encrypted file
ansible-vault edit users.yml
Valult Password:  (enter password here)
note:-once file encrypted with vault you can not run file as it is like,ansible-playbook users.yml

you have to call argument to provide password or u have to provide file where u have mentioned vault password
ansible-playbook users.yml --ask-vault-pass
Vault password: (enter password here)

or created a file say vault-password
ansible-playbook users.yml --vault-password-file /root/ansible/vault-password
-------------------------------
how to change vault password
ansible-vault rekey users.yml
Valult Password:  (enter old password here)
New Valult Password:  (enter new password here)
confirm new password > Rekey successful

if you want to decrypt the file 
ansible-vault decrypt users.yml
Valult Password:  (enter password here)
now you can use any editors to view the the file
