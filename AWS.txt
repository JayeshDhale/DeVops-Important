1)EBS-Elastic Block store --Used to attach for EC2 instances --volumes exist on EBS i.e. virtual hard disk
Volume Type:- 
General purpose ssd (gp2) Most work loads , Max IOPS/Volume is 16000 -- This is default for EC2 instance
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) Databases , Max IOPS/Volume is 64000
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) Big Data & Data Warehouses, Max IOPS/Volume is 500
Cold HDD (sc1) File Servers, Max IOPS/Volume is 250
EBS Magnetic (Standard) Workloads where data is infrequently accessed ,Max IOPS/Volume is 40-200

2)If you want to move EC2 instance from one availability zone to other AZ?
Find your root device volume (EBS), Take sanpshot of it, Go to snapshot and create image out it and deploy it into other AZ.
Or You can copy the existing AMI from current region to diffrent Region.

3)When you create image from EBS Snapshot ,we have two types of Virtualization i.e. Para virtual or hardware virtual machine(PV or HPM)
default is Hardware-assistance Virtualization(HVM)

4)When you delete the EC2 instances, by default,default EBS volume is terminated however additional volumes attached to it will continue to persist

5)You can have 1 EBS for EC2 instance, but in EFS you can have more than 1 EC2 instances attached to it.

6)EC2 Placement Groups
A> Clustered Placement Group
--> Low network latency / High network throughput
-->Cant span multiple AZ
B>Spread palcement Group
-->Individual Critical EC2 instances
-->Can span multiple AZ, but in same region
C>Partitioned
-->Multiple EC2 Instances HDFS,HBase and Cassandra
-->Can span multiple AZ, but in same region

Only certian types of instances can be launched in palcement group
Compute Optimized,GPU,Memory Optimized,Storage Optimized

7)Instance store volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage.It can not be stopped,
we can olny restart or terminate, if underlying host fails you will lose your data.

8)AWS CLI -->SSH to ur EC@ instance and run "aws configure" command u will get aws directory, in that configure u have to provide Access Key ID and Security Access Key.
to view files u have to run "cd .aws" as its hidden.Better secure this using Roles.Roles are universal.

9)Instance meta data -- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
 User meta data -- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/  -- will get boot strap script, which is used to launch EC2 instance.

10)When you create a custom VPC, which of the following are created automatically?
Custom VPC (Default it will create)--> Route Table -->NACL -->Security Groups

create 1 subnet for public and 1 subnet for private (DB)
IGW and attached to VPC, we only have 1 IGW per VPC
create a route table , 1 for public and 1 for private
for public-->assign IGW and Subnet(Public)

Notes:-
A)We have 5 IP address as reserved
251 availabe IP Address  >  
1 for network address
1 for network broadcast
1 Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
1 Reserved by AWS for for the DNS
1 Reserved by AWS for future use

B)Security groups do not span VPC
