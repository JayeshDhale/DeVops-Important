git architecture
Working directory >> staging / Index area >> local repo  >> Remote repo
=========================
mkdir git-demo
git init
ll -al
vi index.html
git status
git add index.html
git status
git commit -m "added file"
(only for first time)
git config --global user.name "jayesh"
git config --global user.email jayeshd@gmail.com
git log
git log --oneline
git ls-files (local repo)
git ls (working directory)
git show <commitid>
git add * (working to local)
(if file is already present, i.e you modify it)
git commit -a -m "modified"

================= day 2
to see unstaged changes -- modify existing 
git diff fiel1.txt
now add file and run ,git diff fiel1.txt --this time git diff will show no values
Now again modify , this time check git status  --file will be in both status staged and unstaged
git diff fiel1.txt
git diff --staged fiel1.txt

----
if you want git to ignore some files use
create a file name .gitignore and put the file that you dont want to ignore
-----------
if you want to change top level commit message
git log --oneline
git commit --amend -m "added few changes"

case 1:if you have added one more file and u dont want to change the last commit message u can use
git commit --amend --> and then hit enter --> dont change the message
if u want to cross verify use
git log --stat  --->this will show us the files that has changed within the commit
-------------
if you want to remember some imp commit id use tag
git tag --a V2.0 f2d1234<commitid> -m "added tags"
git tag
or
git show V2.0
------------
if u want to revert any particular commit
say in commit you have added one file
git log --oneline
git revert 12fg34<commitid>
it will create new commit id
git log --oneline
ls
git ls-files
--------------
to keep only particular commits
git reset --hard 0981234
after this commit it will be deleted everything,and head is pointing to this commit id, i.e in this case top most

How to get back a commit to staging area?
# git reset --soft <previous_commit id>

Reset will work in working area, we can not reset if commit is pushed to Remote repo, suppose commit is pushed to Remote repo
and later we do reset, it will reset working directory, and if we made any changes n try to push it to Remote, in this case conflicts will ocuure,
so to revert any changes from Remote repo we use Revert.

https://dev.to/neshaz/when-to-use-git-reset-git-revert--git-checkout-18je

--soft : Tells Git to reset HEAD to another commit, so index and the working directory will not be altered in any way.
All of the files changed between the original HEAD and the commit will be staged.

--mixed: Just like the soft, this will reset HEAD to another commit. It will also reset the index to match it, while working directory 
will not be touched. All the changes will stay in the working directory and appear as modified, but not staged.
 
>The main difference between --mixed and --soft is whether or not your index is also modified.
--hard: This resets everything - it resets HEAD back to another commit, resets the index to match it, and resets the working directory 
to match it as well.

git reset hard will delete only tracked files, untracked files remains,so remove these fiels run --> "git clean -df"

working index HEAD target         working index HEAD
----------------------------------------------------
 A       B     C    D     --soft   A       B     D
			  --mixed  A       D     D
			  --hard   D       D     D
			  --merge (disallowed)
			  --keep  (disallowed)
-------
if u have modified two files (abcd.txt and xyz.html) and wanted to reset any one of them use
git checkout abcd.txt

git checkout . --> will discard all the changes of all the files in working area

we have modified and added files to index area
git reset HEAD * --> will unstage all changes

git reset HEAD abcd.txt --> for particular file

git reset HEAD~1  -->remove 1st commit
Note:make sure that commit is not present in remote Repo

we can not remove specific commit
-------
now we have couple of commits in system

123456
789654

git reset HEAD~1  -->will point to 789654, remove files from staging and kept in Working directory as modified

we cant remove (reset) any specific reset -- and we can not reset if commit is pushed to Remote repo

default is Mixed
======================
scenario:- we have made git reset --hard  ,but later we come to know, we want that changes back
git reflog --> will show all the log history
git checkout <commitid>  --> commit id will be the recent to that last commit that we want to revert back (before the reset)
git log  --> we can see our chnages are back
git branch backup
so on branch backup u will have ur changes back.

==================
Scenario:- if u want to undo some commit ,but other people have that changes
git revert commitid

git diff 456 123 --> will show diffrence between commits
------------------
Branching and merging
-------------------
git branch  --> will show on which branch u r
-* master
------
To create new branch say b1 barnch
git checkout -b b1 master
or
git branch b2

to delete a branch, which is clean
git branch -d b2

to delete a branch, which has some files which is not commited, then u have to force delete in this case use "D"
git branch -D b2
------------
to go to any specific branch say in this case master
git checkout master
---------------
now we want to bring changes from branch b1 to master  -->we are on master branch
git merge b1
-----------------
if there is a conflict ,say we have two files with same name in both branches, fix the conflict.
it will show you head >> in this case its master,now you have fixed the conflict
git commit -a -m "resolved conflicts"
git status
----------------
if ur working on some files and you dont want to commit, without commiting, as these are incomplete
in this case ur on working directory, and u dont want to lose changes u made to file,u can move changes to some temporary directory

git stash
git status
and then commit

to check stash list
git stash list
git show stash@{0}

later on if u want ,you can get back those changes

git stash pop stash@{0} --> your work will be back in working directory
git status

it will dropped the stash number
git stash list
no more stash

there is another way to unstash
git stash apply stash@{0}
this time stash is not deleted, you can use it for another work or some other branch
---------------------------
if you want to stash new file i.e. untracked file use 
git stash -u

git stash clear --> to clear the stash list
-------------------
git rm filename --> will remove the file from local Repo as well as working directory
git rm --cached filename --> will remove the file only from local Repo but not removed from working directory file system ,
			     so if u want u can add it again

# To remove an entire directory from the working index (cached):
$ git rm -r --cached <directory name>

# To delete an entire directory (force):
$ git rm -r -f <directory name>
========================
git mv --> Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink

Rename
git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> <destination>
ex. git mv index6.txt index7.txt

say we have dir1 and we want to copy file text1.txt from master to dir1
git mv text1.txt dir1

---------------------------------- git bisect
git bisect reset -->is how you stop bisecting. 
By default it will reset the HEAD to where it was before you started, 
although you can also use git bisect reset <commit> to go to that one instead.
If you just want to stop bisecting without changing the commit, from the documentation, git bisect reset HEAD would do what you want.

--------------------- Rebase --> re write the log history
master branch -> have two commits say A  and  B
now created branch B1
so changes will be flow to branch B1  i.e. A  and  B
now you have added one more commit on master branch say C, 
On B1 u have added new commit say D
Now you need to have master changes on that too on B1
so master > A B C
B1 > A B D
after rebase we will have A B C D
u r on branch B1 so run 

git rebase master

if we use merge then we will have A B D C

we can not have rebase on Master branch as we didnt create master branch or master branch is not a copy of any branch
So we can have rebase for other branches,rebase is changing of base of the branch

in this case top most commit id will get change-->only id change everything else will be there

==================== git merge vs rebase --- 6 min
Senarion u have 3 commits on master say m1 m2 m3 and on u made another branch at m2 say b1 branch,now on b1 u have created f1 and f2 commits
when u merge on master it will be like m1 m2 m3 f1 and f2 and one more commit, but if u dont want f1 and f2 only changes should be merged ,use --squash
git merge --squash b1
git commit -m "feature and master merged"
so out put will be m1 m2 m3 and "feature and master merged"

================
scenario :- u have accidently added file and commited on master branch
u go to b1 branch ,run below command
git cherry-pick 12345678<commit id>

now go to master branch and run git reset <commit id>

================
git clean -df
will clean untracked directory and files if any
--------------------Remote repository ------
create new account on Git Hub
create one repository on git hub
its a best practice to always push changes from master branch
to push changes to git hub

git remote add origin "https://github.com/devops-trainer/repo4.git"
git push origin master
it will ask username and password of git hub
now go n check at git hub
-------------
Make sure that when u r clonning u should have empty directory--> and it will get git initialise automatically

mkdir project

now you want to pull changes from Git hub to PC or working directory

git clone https://github.com/devops-trainer/repo4.git
---------------------
git pull origin --> will pull the upadtes / commits
pull= fetch + merge

git fetch origin --> will show there are changes ,but will not download changes on working directory

Note:make sure that when ever ur pushing ur changes to Remote repo, u should have latest copy of that
other wise u will get some conflicts
=============================== look for 
To see which branches are already merged into the branch you’re on, you can run 
git branch --merged

To see all the branches that contain work you haven’t yet merged in, you can run
git branch --no-merged
========================
Git workflow

install git-flow
cd Repositories
cd git-work-flow
git flow init -d

master --> production
develop --> branch for next release 
feature -->
release branch -->
hot fix branch  -->
support branch -->

git flow feature start a-new-feature
o/p:- feature/a-new-feature

before pushing code to git hub
generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jayeshd@gmail.com"

-- .ssh ls  --> look for id_rsa.pub it will have public key and id_rsa will have private key
now go to git hub "SSH Keys" and put that key

now go to repository location and do 
git remote add origin git@github.com:hajjhsdhj/git-workflow

check by using
git remote -v

we normally select develop branch as default branch on git hub

some commands of git workflow
git flow feature
git flow feature publish a-new-feature  -- pushing feature branch in git hub


===========================*****

How to find a list of files that changed during a commit?
git diff-tree -r {hash}
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r {hash}

Git Aliases
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status

git config --list
gedit / vi .gitconfig

Git Working directory messages
->changes not staged for commit
->untracked files
->nothing to commit, working directory is clean

git log --author="jayesh"
git log --before="20may2020"
****************************** Day 3 **********************
Build tool for java is --maven and for .net -NANT,Microsoft build

Most popular integration tool is Jenkins, we also have Traves and bamboo

Why jenkins?
Open source, Good plugin Support,good community support,fast and reliable ,good os support, scripted builds

=================================== Day 4 --1.24
Continuous Deployment-configuration Management with Puppet
IaC -- infra strucutre as a code
Resource abstraction -- Puppet DSL

Puppet master -- Puppet Agent
communication happend by SSL via port no 8140
1) Agent will first send facts (CPU architecture ip address) to master
2) master will identify the facts
3) then master will create or complie a catalog (documnet with all info of config to be done) by puppet code
4) catalog will be sent to agent
5) agnet will appply the catalog

Puppet Architechture
Puppet Agent --->
	     <----Puppet Server --->
					Fetch the node object
						|
					Set Variables
						|
					Assess the main Manifest
						|
					Load classes from modules
						|
					Assess Classes from node object


vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf  -- config setting 2.14

puppet manifest file .pp extenstion means puppet program

by default every 30 min it will poll, but if you want u can run below command
puppet agent --test     #on node (agent)

====================== Day 5
to Aviod same repetative code in Puppet DSL we can have classes

class linux{
 file{'/info.txt':
  ensure => 'present',
  content => "created by puppet",
  }
package{'httpd':
  ensure => 'present',
  }
service{'httpd':
  ensure => 'running',
  enable => true,
  }
}
----------- in node defination

node 'centos-node1'{
 class {'linux':}
}
node 'ubuntu-node2'{
 class {'linux':}
}			
------------
to check any syntax error
puppet parser validate site.pp

---------------- resource declaration
class linux{
 $admintools=['git','nano','screen']		#$ for array declaration
  package{$admintools:
  ensure => 'present',
  }
 file{'/info.txt':
  ensure => 'present',
  content => "created by puppet",
  }
package{'httpd':
  ensure => 'present',
  }
service{'httpd':
  ensure => 'running',
  enable => true,
  }
}

------------------------------------environment is present from puppet version 4
on puppet master
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/testing

mydirk manifests
vi site.pp

and make entry in that file
node 'centos-node1'{
 file{'/info.txt':
  ensure => 'present',
  content => "created by puppet on testing env",
}

now go to puppet agent
vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/pupet.conf
server=puppetmaster
environment=testing

so it will pull changes from now testing environment

--------------------------------
if u want to change run interval-- it will be done in puppet agent
now go to puppet agent
vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/pupet.conf
runinterval=1m
server=puppetmaster
environment=testing

---------------------------modules
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production/modules
generate mediaviki module
puppet module generate mediawiki --environment production

here we have created class under mediawiki location under manifest file, by default if u run agent it will go to default path
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production/manifest
so append or modify manifest file

node 'centos-node1'{
 class {'linux':}
 class {'mediawiki':}
}
node 'ubuntu-node2'{
 class {'linux':}
 class {'mediawiki':}
}
class linux{
 $admintools=['git','nano','screen']		#$ for array declaration
  package{$admintools:
  ensure => 'present',
  }
 file{'/info.txt':
  ensure => 'present',
  content => "created by puppet",
  }
}

------------------
:: -- tp level scope / search for outside the module

============================================= Ansible 2.17
to add user on hosts from master

first make changes in hosts  vi /etc/sudoers set no password
systemctl restart sshd

then on master run below command
ansible webservers -m user -a "name=john password=john" -s

cross verify on host
id john
=================================== day 6
setup module in Ansible, it will show details of host (group) just like facts in Puppet
ansible webservers -m setup

ansible webservers -m setup -a "filter=ansible_user*"		#use some filter, will show you only those details

to check no hosts to be targeted
ansible-playbook palybook.yml --list-hosts

to check syntax
ansible-playbook palybook.yml --syntax-check

we can write script file with extention .sh  # say file is present at tmp location
run by #sh /tmp/test.sh

To check any software or package isnatlled or not use
rpm -qa git

sudo yum install wget

to check some default values, you can also change it as per ur need
cat ansible.cfg

============================ Day 7
