--------------------------------
Three service modesl in AWS
IAAS
PAAS
SAAS
All cloud solutions prodice these three services.


Security	IAAS > PAAS > SAAS
Customize	IAAS > PAAS
Cost		IAAS cost will be less as compare to others.
Administration	IAAS > PAAS > SAAS

Being devops engineer, you shuold be able to decide which tool is suitable.

Deployment modes

Public cloud 			Privat model			Hybrid model				Multicloud
------------			------------			------------				------------
AWS, Azure, GCP			Openstack, VCloud		Comnination of more than		Using multiple public cloud		
								one cloud i.e. on-premised+cloud	i.e. AWS+Azure+GCP etc..
Third higher cost		Higher cost			Second higher				Mostly product base company will prefer to have this.
User:30-40% companies		User: Banks, financial inst	User: Most of the companies
Security: 3rd			Security: Highest 1st		Security: 2nd Higher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS IAM (Identity Access Management)
|
|
|----Root---Owner---Manage------|---Permissions
				|---Billing
				|---Admin previliges
				|---Can create accounts
				|---Can create services

There are two type of policies: AWS Managed policy & Customer managed policy

Root----|---Devops Team---------IAM-devops1 (Here company will provide you account ID)----Need permission now i.e.policies (Devops Administration)
	|		--------IAM-devops2	
	|		--------IAM-devops3
	|[Devops team usually get both access, programmatical & console access]
	|
	|
	|
	|
	|---Developer Team---------Dev-user4 (Each one of dev has uniq secret key and access key) 
	|		  ---------Dev-user5
	|[Developer team usually get programatical access. On to permissions (Lambda,API) ]
	|

We have created two grops: 
Devops		: Same permission given what the above user(iam-user1-devops) is having
Developer	: Same permission given what the above user(dev-user1) is having

But important note is: Apply permission on group level always. Not to give permission users level. Provide users level if you really need some specific permissions.


User						Group	
------------------------------------		----------------------------------------		
A user can be part of group			Group can not be part of different group
A user can be part of multiple group


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


25-05-2019 (Day 2)

When we need to understand about customer managed plolicy, then we need to understand first below service.
Customer managed policy - This means for more precise control. 


1) Lmabda- Service related to development, we are going to assigne that level of services
2) RDS-Relation Database Service
3) EC2- Elastic Compute Cloud
4) VPC:

Note: All above policies are depend on the user needs.


s3- Simple storage service:(PAAS (Platform As A Service))
--------------------------
Storage purpose: Sometimes we call it as Object Storage Services
S3 can store object level data. Data is binary data only e.g. pdf,docs,image,videos,logs,source code.
Now here object is just image. Now the quetion may come liek what would be the size of object?(0kb-5TB/object), How many objects we can store?(Unlimited objects)
Now if you keep on storign millions of object, there may be a problem of seggregation. So in this case AWS provide you one option "Buckets:-Logical Unit". You can create bucket.Default limit is 100 bucket.And you can increase number to 200 only.

Bucket1			bucket2		bucket3
-------			-------		-------
Save unlimited		Save unlimited	Save unlimited
objects			objects		objects

Now, if you create bucket applicaton wise, then there may be data saved for QA env, Dev evn & Prod env. Again there is mess. 
If you create bucket on environment basis, i.e. one bucket for QA env, 2nd for Dev env, 3rd for prod env. This is something looks better than above.
Here precise control comes into picture. You can provide specific permission to particular environment group.You can manage permission/plicy at bucket level or object level in the buckets.

Within bucket you can created sub-folders.

Interview question: May ask how many applicatons you have. Consider 10. Simply we can have 30 buckets for 3 different environment.Bucket is just pay as you go model.If you store data then you have to pay. If you do not store any data and you created bucket then you don't have to pay anything.


-> Create bucket: While creating bucket usually each company have their it's own naming convention.
Whle creating bucket, there is one option Region.There are different different region. So it is nothing but geographical location.Usually we select nearest location. You can edit region once you create bucket.
We need to take care of three points while selecting region: High Avaialability, High Bandwidth, Low Latency

AWS provide facility to upload your data across various region.

Now go to bucket page and right click on it. Copy object URL(each object have it's own URL) and paste it on another tab: You will see there an error "Access denied".And this is due to permission limitation.

Here is why: Bucket
		|

		|
		|---object1
		|---object2 etc

S3 policies---Bucket level
	   ---Object level


so you need to have bucket level permissions. 
Go to bucket page > Click on Permission > Click on Edit under Block Public Access section > Turn it OFF > Now click on object > Click on Permission > Select Everyone > Select Read Object > Save 

Now try accessing URL, you should be able to access data which you had uploaded.

Moving ahead, We have concept of versioning so here is versioning on aws s3 services. 
Create one more bucket > provide different name > click on Next > Select check box "Keep all versions...."

There is an account "Free-Tier-Limit" but here you can store objects of only 5GB.

Assignment: Now your bucket is deleted from iam user because administrator access. Now remove access, again create bucket via devops user and give permissions and sign in by iam user and try to delete bucket.

Interview question: 1. Whether action is by default allow or deny? Deny means restrict few people.
		    2. Have you ever created plolicy?
		    3. Which policy you have created? Ans- Yea, read policy
		    4. Can you disable versioning? Ans- No.You can only suspend versioning. 
Prefer to have one plicy for one service.


Assignment: Create user let say Developer.

Developer(user)--->cteate plolicy for dev user---| s3 -> write
		    			   | API Gateway -> write
		    			   | Lambda -> Write
		    			   | RDS -> Read


25-05-2019 (Day 3)

Storage Classes (Storage type)

1) Genral purpose storage (Standard storage): It is for data that is accessed very frequently. It offers high availability (that means your data is replicated on multiple devices internally), durability, provides very low latency High through put.

Durability: 99.9
9999999999 (More the durability, lesser the chances of data loss).  

availability: 99.99
Retrival time: if time is better then cost will be high

2) Standard Infrequent Access (Standard IA): It is for data that is accessed very infrequently. If offers high availability (that means your data is replicated on multiple devices internally), durability, provides very high latency than standard storage, 
High through put.

Durability: 99.99
Avaialbility: 99.99
Retrieval time: High as compared to standard storage.
Ex.To store data like logs which older than 1 month.

Ex. Dynamic websites, cloud bases applicatoin, big data (When there is high throughput, big data comes into picture), gaming etc.

3) Glacier: For backup and archieve purpose

Retrieval time: very high
durability: 99.99
availability: 99.99
Ex: Logs (Older than 1 year imp data, complience data)

4) Intelligent Tiering: AWS analyze the object access for 30 days. If data is being used within 30 days, then AWS store your data from Intellligent to Standard storage.If data is being used oftenly the AWS will store your data from 
Interlligne tiering to Standard storage automatically.

So now above all 4 option storing your data on multiple zones. That means your cost is still high. But if you have a data which is not important for you and you feel that is no longer in use further. Then why to store in multiple 
zones and why to pay high cost. IN this case you can use one below option "One-Zone Infrequent".

5) One-Zone infrequent: Data which is being used very less oftenly.
Availability: High
Durability: Low
Retireval time: High like in seconds
Cost: Low
Latency: Low

Interview question: What is that service for backup and archieve? Which storage class is by default? Ans- Standard Storage.

Retrieval types in terms of time:
1) Data can be retrieved within 1-3 minutes
2) Data can be retrieve within 1-3 hours
3) Data can be retrieve within 5-6 days

Life Cycles policy for s3: This is set of rules. We can move data from one storage to another storage class automatically.

User data upload----->Standard storage--------->Infrequent Access-------->Glacier------------>Delete
	   	      Bills(Min 30 days)	(Min 30 days)		  (Min 60 days)
The above process is done automatically.

Here you can create life cycle on bucket level and object level as well. Just give a try for creating life cycle.

-------

Next Topic: EC2 (Most of the activities is done on EC2 in real time)
EC2 comes under IAAS
In Interview perspective, you need remember type. 
-> Now create instance and launch it. Your instance can run for totak 750 hours. So once you are done with taks then used to stop it.
-> Once you create instance then login using user name "ec2-user" via putty. 

Fire following commands:
-sudo yum update
-sudo yum install httpd
-sudo service httpd start
-sudo service https status
-cd /var/www
-sudo vi index.html: Put sample code of html
-Once done try accessing url: http://18.191.158.156:80/index.html


SEcurity group: -We have seen this while creating instance. This is nothing but virtual firewall rules
		-Contains inbound and outbound rules.
		-There is NO Deny rule ( We can not block any network or any IP range). This means that, we can only allow.
		-Can apply rules at ec2 level
		-We can apply max 250 rules. Means 25 security group and each may contains 10 rules.

Rule format: protocal - port - source.

For next session: Be prepare with IP classes, IP range, diff between public IP and Private IP, what is subnet mask, What is subnet.

C	192.168.0.0		255.255.0.0	192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

-------------
Private IP addresses
Private IP addresses are the IP addresses which are reserved for local networks and cannot be accessed from a public network such as Internet. Vice versa a public network cannot be accessed from a private IP address.

Following IP ranges are reserved for private IP addresses.

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
Public IP addresses
Public IP addresses are the IP addresses which are publicly accessible from any public network such as Internet. In order to access a public IP address, we must have to use a public IP address.

Except private IP addresses, all IP addresses of class A, B and C are public IP addresses.

Special IP addresses
Special IP addresses are the IP addresses which are reserved for network testing and troubleshooting. These IP addresses cannot be assigned to an end device or an interface. Following addresses are reserved for special purpose: -

0.0.0.0:- This is the first IP address of IP addresses. It represents all networks.

127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255: - Reserved for IP protocol testing and troubleshooting. Virtual interfaces such as loopback adaptor use this IP range for addressing.

224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Class D): - Reserved for multicast addresses. A multicast address is an address which has multiple recipients.

240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (Class E): - Reserved for future use. These addresses are not used currently for any purpose.

255.255.255.255:- This is the last IP address of IP addresses. It represents all hosts.

-----------------
Subnet Mask
Subnet mask is used to separate the network address from the host address in IP address. As we discussed earlier an IP address is the combination of network address and host address, subnet mask helps us and programs which use IP address in identifying the network portion and the host portion.

Just like IP address, subnet mask is also 32 bits in length and uses same notations which IP address uses to present itself.

Subnet mask assigns an individual bit for each bit of IP address. If IP bit belongs to network portion, assigned subnet mask bit will be turned on. If IP bit belongs to host portion, assigned subnet mask bit will be turned off.

In binary notation, 1 (one) represents a turned on bit while 0 (zero) represents a turned off bit. In dotted-decimal notation, a value range 1 to 255 represents a turned on bit while a value 0 (zero) represents a turned off bit.

a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
